# Interview guide

**Interview counter:**  
*As interviewer:* 12  
*As candidate:* 30  

_This is to make sure you read this with a grain of salt, I'm far from an expert on this matter. I'm open to suggestions, feel free to reach me!_

-------
This is a simple handbook to help me navigate my interviews - either as an interviewer or candidate.  
Here you will be able to find topics that I like to talk about and some thoughtful questions.

This is **WIP**, with time I will always try to enrich this repo with more content.

The objective of this repo is to improve my skills as an interviewer and to perform better as a candidate.

All of the content here is based on my experience alone. If anything here is not mine I will let that be known explicitly.

## What to expect

I'm a very curious person, I will always try to ask a lot of things so I can get the best from people. This is not to screw them over, quite the opposite is to bring the best of them. I hate tricky questions, I always try to do straightforward, clear, and objective questions, so I can gather real information either about the person or the company.

Remember, the interview is always a two-way street, so never go thinking that you are the only one judging. As an interviewer you also have to sell to the candidate why should we want to go to your company.

## Interviewer

From past experiences we have been improving the way we lead the interview, this is important so we can have the candidate talk about the good stuff without us asking direct questions.
Personally, I like to take notes during the interview so I can make questions related to the context in that particular moment. This way we can get more insight throughout the interview.

### Topics

Let get straight into the topics.

- Past experiences (the most significant ones)
- Side projects
- Hobbies
- Thoughts on current tech
- Ambitions
- Life goals
- Sports

Some of this seems like random topics but every single one of these topics helps to get a bit more info about the person and likely is the person to be a good fit for the company. Have in mind that if it is a technical interview maybe the focus should be on past experiences and side projects as the others will not help you that much in trying to figure out if the person has hard skills.
### Questions

Apart from questions within the context of the interview these are some of the questions I like to ask

```
Best project your work on and why?
```
This can get the conversation going, take some notes and do some follow-up questions on the subject.

```
Why are you looking for new opportunities?
```
This depends on if the candidate was the one that applied, if no, then the question is still valid but better in a different way.
This question helps to understand the candidate's motivations.

```
Can you name the toughest challenge that you faced and how you solve it?
```
In this one, we can get a sense of some soft skills and also get the conversation going on some technical questions.

```
What do you like to do outside of work - Hobbies?
```
This is more of a question to see if the candidate stands out from the others. With this info, we can get to know more of the motivations and what does inspire the person to work.

```
If you could pick any job in the world, what would it be?
```
Again, this is more of a creative question, this is to get a sense of soft skills and also the candidate's ability to communicate and express himself. _Do not use this question to rule out candidates._

```
How do you stay up-to-date with the latest news regarding your areas of interest?
```
This is more to see how interested the candidate is and how is keeping up with the latest news and tech. Especially in tech, the standards are always evolving very fast so better to always follow the news/communities.

```
What do you think of open-source software?
```
This can be controversial because there are some companies against this but you think well, almost every company uses some type or form of OOS...
This can be a really good starting question because leads to a lot of follow-up questions regarding our current state in the tech environment.
## Candidate

Very important, ALWAYS prepare for the interview. Can be an opening interview or technical, doesn't matter. Being prepared for the interview is one step closer to getting in. Research the company, industry, competitors, etc... For technical interviews, just study study study and practice the common interview exercises.

Interviews can be very tricky... To increase your chances of figuring out if this is the right company, start with the interviewers, they are the ones representing the company. Try to get a sense of their style and what are their intentions. Are they trying to single you out? Screw you over with tricky and stupid questions? Always, in doubt ask bluntly that you didn't follow or didn't understand the question. Remember these are the people you will work with... You got to choose your coworkers wisely.
Your best weapon is your questions. Don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions, and if needed explain why you are asking. This can even make you stand out, the average candidates will not make more than 2/3 questions. Making questions is a sign that you care about where you work, it means that you are curious and not just on the lookout for a new gig.
### Topics

The topics... This one can be difficult because you are not in charge of the interview but anyhow if you can bring something up these are some of them.

- Culture
- Company industry
- Onboarding
- Feedback system
- career ladder
- company future
- job expectations
- team current problems

### Questions

Now the juicy part, the real questions for the candidates. These can easily make you stand out from the crowd. Always be honest and straight-forward with your intentions. Use these questions to try to catch some red flags along the way.

```
What is expected from me over the first 90 days?
```
Most people will not be ready to answer this question but you for sure will get some info that is worth something. If you are not happy try to do a follow-up question to get more info.

```
How does the team plan the work for the week?
```
Nowadays the answer will be something like - agile or kanban - but you might be surprised at how many companies are a mess regarding work planning.

```
How is the daily routine of a developer?
```
Again, to get a sense of how people work in the company.

```
How is your onboarding structured?
```
This is very important, a really good onboarding can set you up for success in no time. If the onboarding is weak or non-existing this can get you frustrated in the first weeks/months because you will be forced to get to know a lot of things on your own.

```
How often does an employee receive feedback?
```
For me, this is a major red flag. If there is no feedback system, how the hell am I suppose to know if I'm doing what is expected of me? Try to figure out this one, this is what will help you improve and know what to get better.

```
Are there any 1vs1 with the manager?
```
This is up to you, some people like 1vs1 others don't. Personally, I think they are really important and useful.

```
What are the company plans for the future - let's say 5 years?
```
This is important, especially for startups. Is mandatory to know if the company you are about to join has potential and will is not near bankruptcy.

```
Why does [company name] is looking for a new [position name]?
```
Did someone leave the company? Did they let someone go? Are they growing?

```
How does your career ladder work?
```
This is to know if there is any chance of career progression, we all work for something, being promoted is one of them because it means you are improving, getting better, and growing.

```
What are the team's struggles and strengths?
```
To see what are the real problems and how are they solving them.
